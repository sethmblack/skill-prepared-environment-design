# Prepared Environment Design

Analyze and redesign any learning space or work environment using Montessori principles to support independent, self-directed activity.

---

## When to Use

- Setting up a classroom, home learning space, or workspace
- Troubleshooting why a space "isn't working"
- Request to "design a Montessori environment"
- Questions about why learners are distracted, dependent, or disengaged
- Any environment intended to support learning or development

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| space_description | Yes | Physical characteristics of the space |
| users | Yes | Who will use this space (age, number, characteristics) |
| activities | No | What activities should the space support |
| constraints | No | Budget, physical limitations, shared space, etc. |

## The Six Principles of Prepared Environment

### Principle 1: Child-Sized (User-Proportioned)

Everything should be proportioned for the user to act independently:
- Furniture at appropriate height
- Materials at accessible shelves
- Tools sized for the user's hands
- Controls and switches reachable

**Diagnostic question:** Can the user access everything they need without adult assistance?

### Principle 2: Accessible

Materials should be visible, reachable, and inviting:
- Open shelves (not closed cabinets)
- Materials at eye-level and arm-reach
- Clear organization by activity or subject
- Nothing "put away" that should be available

**Diagnostic question:** Can the user see what's available and get it themselves?

### Principle 3: Ordered

The environment should have a clear, logical structure:
- Everything has a designated place
- Materials arranged from simple to complex
- Left-to-right, top-to-bottom organization
- Clear boundaries between activity areas

**Diagnostic question:** Does the user know where everything belongs?

### Principle 4: Beautiful

The environment should invite engagement through aesthetic quality:
- Natural materials where possible (wood, glass, fabric)
- Plants and living things
- Natural light
- Clean, well-maintained materials
- Artful displays

**Diagnostic question:** Does the space feel calm, inviting, and worthy of respect?

### Principle 5: Limited

Less is more in the prepared environment:
- Only materials that serve current developmental needs
- Not overwhelming with choices
- Each material has a purpose
- Rotate rather than accumulate

**Diagnostic question:** Could the user choose without being overwhelmed?

### Principle 6: Real

The environment should offer authentic activity:
- Real tools, not toys (within safety)
- Real glass, real ceramics (children learn to be careful)
- Meaningful work, not busywork
- Activities that matter to the community

**Diagnostic question:** Are the activities genuinely purposeful?

## The Design Process

### Step 1: Observe the Current State

Before redesigning, document:
- How does the space currently function?
- What do users actually do (not what you intend)?
- Where do problems occur?
- What works well?

### Step 2: Audit Against the Six Principles

For each principle, assess:
- Does the current environment meet this principle?
- What specific elements violate it?
- What would be needed to address it?

### Step 3: Identify Obstacles

Common obstacles to independent activity:
- Materials stored out of reach
- Closed storage hiding options
- Adult-sized furniture requiring assistance
- Clutter creating overwhelm
- Missing materials for complete activity cycles
- Disorganization preventing self-correction

### Step 4: Design for Activity Cycles

Each activity should be complete and self-contained:
- All materials needed are together
- Activity can be started, completed, and cleaned up independently
- Clear beginning and end
- Obvious place to return materials

### Step 5: Plan for Maintenance

The prepared environment requires ongoing attention:
- Daily: Restore order, replace materials
- Weekly: Clean, repair, rotate as needed
- Monthly: Observe and adjust to changing needs

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

### Principle Audit

| Principle | Current State | Recommendations |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Child-Sized | [assessment] | [specific changes] |
| Accessible | [assessment] | [specific changes] |
| Ordered | [assessment] | [specific changes] |
| Beautiful | [assessment] | [specific changes] |
| Limited | [assessment] | [specific changes] |
| Real | [assessment] | [specific changes] |

### Key Obstacles Identified
1. [Obstacle]: [How it prevents independence]
2. [Obstacle]: [How it prevents independence]

### Priority Redesign Recommendations
1. [Highest impact change]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

### Activity Cycle Design
[For key activities, specify how materials should be organized for complete, independent cycles]

### Maintenance Plan
- Daily: [tasks]
- Weekly: [tasks]
- As needed: [observations to make]
```

## Constraints

- Focus on environmental factors, not learner deficits
- Assume the environment is the primary lever for change
- Recommend real materials and authentic activities
- Prioritize independence over convenience
- Acknowledge constraints but don't let them prevent progress

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**

## Example

**Input:** "I want to set up a learning corner in my living room for my 4-year-old. We have a 6x8 foot space. Currently it has a toy box, a kid's table, and a bookshelf with books mixed with toys. She doesn't seem interested and makes a mess."

**Output:**

## Prepared Environment Analysis

### Space Summary
A 6x8 foot corner of a living room intended as a learning/activity space for a 4-year-old. Currently configured with mixed storage that does not invite purposeful activity.

### Principle Audit

| Principle | Current State | Recommendations |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Child-Sized | Table appears appropriate | Verify chair height allows feet flat on floor, table at elbow height |
| Accessible | Toy box hides contents; bookshelf mixes categories | Replace toy box with low open shelf; separate books from materials |
| Ordered | No apparent organization | Dedicate specific shelves to specific activities; use trays to contain each activity |
| Beautiful | Not assessed | Add a small plant, natural materials, possibly a framed art print at child height |
| Limited | Too many items visible | Remove 2/3 of materials; rotate weekly; store excess out of sight |
| Real | Not assessed | Replace plastic with wood/glass where possible; add real practical life activities |

### Key Obstacles Identified
1. **Toy box storage:** Child cannot see options; digging creates mess; no defined place for items
2. **Mixed categories:** Books with toys prevents systematic exploration; no clear purpose areas
3. **Too many items:** Overwhelm prevents choice; impossible to maintain order

### Priority Redesign Recommendations
1. **Replace toy box with two-shelf open unit** - Each item visible on its own tray or basket. Child sees all options and knows where each belongs.
2. **Create activity trays** - Each activity on its own tray with all needed materials. Child takes tray to table, works, returns complete tray to shelf.
3. **Rotate to 6-8 activities maximum** - Currently too many items. Store extras in closet, rotate weekly based on what she chooses.

### Activity Cycle Design
Example for art activity:
- Small tray containing: 4 colored pencils in holder, small pad of paper, pencil sharpener
- Child takes entire tray to table
- Works independently
- Returns pencils to holder, sharpener to tray, places tray back on designated shelf spot
- Used paper goes to designated "finished work" basket or folder

### Maintenance Plan
- Daily: Return all trays to shelves; restore order before bed
- Weekly: Observe which activities are chosen/ignored; rotate 1-2 items
- As needed: Replace consumables, repair materials, add new activities following her interests

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Maria Montessori** expert persona. Use it when any learning or working environment needs design or troubleshooting, grounded in the principle that the environment does the teaching.
